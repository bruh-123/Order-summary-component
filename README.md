## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The first time I have worked with svg images. I knew nothing but Imanage to complete the challenge.

### Continued development

I want to try solving the next challenges with just HTML CSS and JS. I think that will allow me to work better with React in the future.


### Useful resources

- Chakra (chakra-ui.com) the chats on their repository helped a lot.
